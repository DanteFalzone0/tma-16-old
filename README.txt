/* NOTICE posted 30 December 2019

I am archiving much of my old code from when I was first learning to program. The code in this repository is embarassingly bad, and it's not how I would write code to do something similar today. Please don't take this repository as an example of my programming habits and knowledge; look at my more recent repositories instead. */


This is the old code for the TMA-16. It contains a shitty implementation of the
TMA-16 (version 1.2) written in Python, as well as a modified implementation for
Windows compatibility.

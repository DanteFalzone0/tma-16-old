* This directory contains several source code files written in TMA-16 Assembly,
  all of which can be assembled and run using the assembler in the parent directory.

* It also contains a file named "asm.nanorc" which can be used to tell the Nano
  text editor how to highlight TMA-16 Assembly.

* It also contains a TMA-16 executable named "no_asm.tmx", which was written in raw
  bytecode using a hex editor, as it will proudly tell you if you run it. This was
  written just to flex on the kind of people who complain that C is too low-level.
